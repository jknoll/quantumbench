  "reasoning_trace": "Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems, which is fundamental to understanding quantum advantage in computational tasks. For a 3-qubit system with N=8 possible states, we need to search for the marked state |101⟩ among all possibilities. The algorithm works by repeatedly applying two key operations: an oracle that flips the phase of the marked state, and a diffusion operator that performs inversion about the average amplitude.\n\nThe mathematical foundation begins with initializing all qubits in superposition using Hadamard gates, creating the state |ψ⟩ = (1/√8)∑|x⟩ where each computational basis state has equal amplitude 1/√8. The oracle function f(x) = 1 if x = |101⟩ and 0 otherwise, implemented as a phase oracle that applies a -1 phase to the marked state. This requires constructing a multi-controlled Z gate that activates when qubits 0 and 2 are in state |1⟩ and qubit 1 is in state |0⟩.\n\nThe optimal number of iterations for Grover's algorithm is approximately π√N/4 ≈ π√8/4 ≈ 2.22, so we use 2 iterations to maximize success probability. Each iteration consists of the oracle followed by the diffusion operator. The diffusion operator can be decomposed as H⊗n · (2|0⟩⟨0| - I) · H⊗n, which in practice means applying Hadamard gates, flipping the phase of the |000⟩ state, and applying Hadamard gates again.\n\nThe circuit implementation requires careful construction of the oracle using controlled gates. For the marked state |101⟩, we need to detect when qubits 0 and 2 are |1⟩ and qubit 1 is |0⟩. This is achieved by applying an X gate to qubit 1 (to flip |0⟩ to |1⟩), then applying a multi-controlled Z gate on all three qubits, and finally applying X to qubit 1 again to restore the original state. The diffusion operator implementation follows the standard decomposition with multi-controlled Z gates.\n\nAfter 2 iterations, the amplitude of the marked state |101⟩ should be approximately 0.946, giving a success probability of about 89.4%. The remaining probability is distributed among the other 7 states. This represents a significant improvement over classical random search, which would have only a 12.5% success probability per measurement. The verification involves running the circuit multiple times and analyzing the measurement statistics to confirm the amplitude amplification effect.",
