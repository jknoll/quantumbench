## Quantum Computing Fine Tune Dataset

This is a project to produce a data set of prompts describing a computational problem which are mapped to Qiskit code to execute the problem, along with expected correct outputs and reasoning traces. This dataset can be used for fine tuning.

See `milestones.md` for project milestones and implementation status.
